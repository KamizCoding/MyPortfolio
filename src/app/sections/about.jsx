                <h1 className="">A little bit about me</h1>
                <p>I'm Lukmaan Kamiss, a software engineer based in Kandy, Sri Lanka, specializing in full-stack development with a focus on building practical, user-centered applications. I recently completed my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at APIIT and have spent the past few years turning ideas into functional solutions across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

                    My expertise spans the modern JavaScript ecosystem—React, Next.js, and the MERN stack—along with experience in PHP/Laravel, C#/.NET, and mobile development with Flutter. I'm particularly drawn to projects that solve real problems, whether that's building real-time chat systems, e-commerce platforms, or integrating AI capabilities like speech-to-text translation.

                    At Verve Automation, I worked on everything from responsive mobile apps to full-stack e-commerce solutions, collaborating in an Agile environment and sharpening my approach to clean, maintainable code. I believe the best software strikes a balance between technical excellence and genuine usability—code that works well and feels good to use.

                    When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or finding ways to optimize the applications I've already built. I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or discussing opportunities where I can contribute and continue growing as a developer.</p>
